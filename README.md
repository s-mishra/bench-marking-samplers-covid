## Notice
 :warning: This code shouldn't be used for inferring any estimates. It is mainly for benchmarking purposes. For actual code look [here](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19mode)

:warning: This code is released with no support. We try our best to look at issues and pull request but can't help people with setup most of the time.

:warning: This model is in active development and so parameter name and behaviours, and output file formats will change without notice.

:warning: As with any mathematical model, it is easy to misconfigure inputs and therefore get meaningless outputs. The development team only endorses outputs it has itself generated.
